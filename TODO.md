# Email Service Analytics Refactoring TODO

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Renamed `getEmailAnalytics` method to `getEmailLogAnalytics` in EmailService
- [x] Updated EmailController to use `getEmailLogAnalytics` for individual email analytics
- [x] Renamed controller method from `getAnalytics` to `getEmailLogAnalytics` for clarity
- [x] Renamed range analytics method to `getAnalyticsByRange` in controller
- [x] Updated tests to call `getEmailLogAnalytics` instead of `getEmailAnalytics`
- [x] Added test for NotFoundException in `getEmailLogAnalytics`
- [x] Added tests for `getEmailAnalytics` (range analytics) method

## Pending Tasks

- [ ] Install missing dependencies if needed (TypeScript errors indicate missing @nestjs/\* packages)
- [ ] Run tests to ensure all pass
- [ ] Verify API endpoints work correctly
- [ ] Update any documentation or API specs if needed

## Notes

- The original `getEmailAnalytics` method was overloaded (one for date range, one for emailId)
- Split into two distinct methods: `getEmailAnalytics` for range analytics and `getEmailLogAnalytics` for individual email analytics
- Controller methods renamed for clarity to avoid confusion
