# Accessibility Testing Guide for StrellerMinds

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing accessibility features in the StrellerMinds platform. It covers automated testing, manual testing procedures, and user testing methodologies.

## Automated Testing Setup

### 1. Install Testing Dependencies

```bash
# Install accessibility testing tools
npm install --save-dev @axe-core/playwright axe-core jest-axe
npm install --save-dev lighthouse pa11y
```

### 2. Configure Jest for Accessibility Testing

```javascript
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/test/setup-accessibility.js'],
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
};
```

```javascript
// test/setup-accessibility.js
import { toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe';
expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations);
```

### 3. Example Accessibility Tests

```typescript
// test/accessibility/user-settings.test.ts
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import { axe } from 'jest-axe';
import UserSettingsPage from '../src/pages/UserSettings';

describe('User Settings Accessibility', () => {
  it('should not have accessibility violations', async () => {
    const { container } = render(<UserSettingsPage />);
    const results = await axe(container);
    expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
  });

  it('should have proper heading structure', async () => {
    const { container } = render(<UserSettingsPage />);
    const headings = container.querySelectorAll('h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6');
    
    // Check that there's only one h1
    const h1Elements = container.querySelectorAll('h1');
    expect(h1Elements).toHaveLength(1);
    
    // Check heading hierarchy
    let previousLevel = 0;
    headings.forEach((heading) => {
      const currentLevel = parseInt(heading.tagName.charAt(1));
      expect(currentLevel).toBeLessThanOrEqual(previousLevel + 1);
      previousLevel = currentLevel;
    });
  });

  it('should have accessible form labels', () => {
    const { container } = render(<UserSettingsPage />);
    const inputs = container.querySelectorAll('input, select, textarea');
    
    inputs.forEach((input) => {
      const label = container.querySelector(`label[for="${input.id}"]`);
      const ariaLabel = input.getAttribute('aria-label');
      const ariaLabelledBy = input.getAttribute('aria-labelledby');
      
      expect(
        label || ariaLabel || ariaLabelledBy
      ).toBeTruthy();
    });
  });
});
```

### 4. Lighthouse CI Configuration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/accessibility.yml
name: Accessibility Testing
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  accessibility:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build
      
      - name: Run Lighthouse CI
        run: |
          npm install -g @lhci/cli
          lhci autorun
        env:
          LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN }}
```

## Manual Testing Procedures

### Keyboard Navigation Testing

#### Test Checklist
- [ ] All interactive elements are reachable via Tab key
- [ ] Tab order is logical and intuitive
- [ ] Focus indicators are clearly visible
- [ ] No keyboard traps (except intentional ones)
- [ ] Escape key closes modals and dropdowns
- [ ] Enter and Space keys activate buttons
- [ ] Arrow keys work in menus and lists

#### Testing Steps
1. **Start with a fresh page load**
2. **Use only the keyboard** (disconnect mouse if necessary)
3. **Press Tab repeatedly** and verify:
   - Focus moves to each interactive element
   - Focus indicators are visible
   - Order makes logical sense
4. **Test specific interactions**:
   - Forms: Can you fill out and submit?
   - Menus: Can you navigate and select items?
   - Modals: Can you open, interact with, and close?

### Screen Reader Testing

#### NVDA Testing (Windows)
1. **Download and install NVDA** (free)
2. **Start NVDA** and turn off your monitor
3. **Navigate the site** using only audio feedback
4. **Test key functions**:
   - Page navigation (H key for headings)
   - Form completion
   - Link activation
   - Content reading

#### Testing Script Example
```
1. Load the course enrollment page
2. Use H key to navigate through headings
3. Verify page structure is announced correctly
4. Navigate to the enrollment form
5. Fill out form fields using Tab and arrow keys
6. Verify error messages are announced
7. Submit form and verify success message
```

### Visual Testing

#### Color Contrast Testing
1. **Use WebAIM Contrast Checker**
2. **Test all text/background combinations**
3. **Verify minimum ratios**:
   - Normal text: 4.5:1
   - Large text: 3:1
   - UI components: 3:1

#### Color Blindness Testing
1. **Use browser extensions** (Stark, Colorblinding)
2. **Test with different types**:
   - Protanopia (red-blind)
   - Deuteranopia (green-blind)
   - Tritanopia (blue-blind)
3. **Verify information isn't conveyed by color alone**

#### Zoom Testing
1. **Set browser zoom to 200%**
2. **Verify all content is still accessible**
3. **Check for horizontal scrolling**
4. **Test functionality at high zoom levels**
