# Database Optimization Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the database optimization strategies implemented in the application to improve query performance and overall system efficiency.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Indexing Strategy
- Added indexes on frequently queried columns:
  - `email` (unique index)
  - `role` (for role-based queries)
  - `status` (for filtering active/inactive users)
  - `createdAt` (for date-based queries and sorting)

### 2. Query Optimizations
- **Pagination**: Implemented in `findAll` queries to limit result sets
- **Selective Loading**: Using `select` option to fetch only required fields
- **Relation Loading**: Optimized with `relations` parameter
- **Query Caching**: Implemented with 1-minute cache duration
- **Soft Delete**: Replaced hard deletes with soft deletes

### 3. Connection Pool Optimization
- Increased max pool size to 20
- Set minimum pool size to 5
- Configured idle timeout to 30 seconds
- Implemented retry mechanism (5 attempts with 3-second delay)

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- Implemented `DatabaseMonitoringService` for:
  - Slow query detection (threshold: 1000ms)
  - Query logging in development
  - Performance metrics collection

### 5. Error Handling
- Implemented specific error types
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Improved error messages for better debugging

## Performance Tests
- Added performance test suite in `users.service.spec.ts`
- Tests cover:
  - Pagination performance
  - Relation loading efficiency
  - Concurrent request handling

## Monitoring and Metrics
- Query execution time tracking
- Slow query detection and logging
- Connection pool usage monitoring
- Error rate tracking

## Best Practices
1. Always use pagination for list queries
2. Select only required fields
3. Use appropriate indexes
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Monitor query performance
6. Use connection pooling effectively

## Future Improvements
1. Implement read replicas for heavy read operations
2. Add more comprehensive performance metrics
3. Implement query result caching for frequently accessed data
4. Regular database maintenance scheduling
5. Consider implementing database sharding for large datasets
