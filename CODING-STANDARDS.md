# Coding Standards

- Prettier is mandatory for formatting.
- NPM is a recommended tool for package management.

## Naming Conventions

- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Variables & functions: `camelCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_CASE`

## Code Practices

- Avoid `any`
- Use DTOs for request validation
- Keep services lean and reusable
- Write unit tests for all critical modules

## Git Practices

- Use feature branches
- Follow conventional commits (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`)
- Run tests before PR
